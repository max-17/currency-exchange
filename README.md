Currency Exchange Management System - Project Plan

1. Core Entities & Database
   Users (admins, managers, staff)
   Branches (exchange shops)
   Currencies (USD, EUR, etc.)
   Exchange Rates (with history log)

Balance (per branch, per currency, tracked historically)
ExchangeRate (per branch, per currency, with history)
Transaction (buy/sell, amount, currency, branch)

4. Pages

Login Page
Dashboard (branch overview, rates, balances)
Balance Page (details + analytics)
Rates Page (update & view history)
Transactions Page
Reports Page
Admin Management (users, branches, global settings)

5. Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TailwindCSS, ShadCN UI
Backend: Next.js API Routes / tRPC
Database: Noen + Prisma ORM
Auth: NextAuth.js (credentials/SSO)
Hosting: Vercel

6. Phases

Phase 1: Setup & Auth

Initialize Next.js project, configure DB
Implement auth & roles (Admin/Manager)

Phase 2: Branch & User Management

Admin can add/edit/delete branches and assign managers

Phase 3: Balances & Rates

Schema + API for balances and exchange rates
Dashboard UI for managers/admins

Phase 4: Transactions & History

Implement buy/sell transaction system
Auto-update balances
History tracking

Phase 5: Reports & Analytics

Charts for daily/weekly/monthly balance changes
Admin aggregated view

Phase 6: Polishing & Deployment

Role-based UI adjustments
Export features
Deploy to production

## Detailed Tasks (by page / component / feature)

### Pages

- Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

  - [ ] Finish component wiring for live data (replace mock data with real API)
  - [ ] Add branch switcher for Admins to toggle data scope
  - [ ] Implement pagination / lazy loading for exchange history
  - [ ] Add filtering by date / currency and export CSV
  - [ ] Accessibility audit and keyboard navigation

- Balance (`/dashboard/balance`)

  - [ ] Replace mock balance calculations with server-side queries
  - [ ] Implement aggregated balance view for Admins
  - [ ] Make `BalanceTransactionForm` submit to server and update UI (optimistic update)
  - [ ] Add validation and edge-case handling (e.g., insufficient funds)
  - [ ] Unit tests for balance calculations and chart rendering

- Managers (`/dashboard/managers`)

  - [x] Table UI with create/edit/delete flows
  - [ ] Implement server-side update (PATCH/PUT) and wire edit flow in `UserForm`
  - [ ] Add delete confirmation modal and error handling
  - [ ] Pagination, search and filters (by role, branch)
  - [ ] Audit log for user changes (who changed what)

- Profile (`/dashboard/profile`)

  - [ ] Implement profile editing, avatar upload, and change password
  - [ ] Add email verification flow and display verification status

- Stats (`/dashboard/stats`)
  - [ ] Implement charts (Recharts/Chart.js) for trends
  - [ ] Add filters (branch, currency, date range)
  - [ ] Export reports (CSV/PDF)

### Core Components

- `UserForm` (`components/user-form.tsx`)

  - [ ] Call `form.reset(defaultValues)` when `defaultValues` changes
  - [ ] Support both create and update (use `onSubmit` to call createUser/updateUser based on presence of `id`)
  - [ ] Add client-side validation messages and loading states
  - [ ] Write unit tests (react-hook-form + zod) for valid/invalid submissions

- `BalanceTransactionForm` (`components/balance-transaction-form.tsx`)

  - [ ] Wire to server actions and update `BalanceTransactionHistory` on success
  - [ ] Prevent double submissions and show success/failure toasts

- `ExchangeHistoryTable` (`components/exchange-history-table.tsx`)

  - [ ] Add server pagination / infinite scrolling
  - [ ] Add filters and CSV export

- `CurrencyExchangeForm` (`components/currency-exchange-form.tsx`)

  - [ ] Replace mock rate calculation with live lookup
  - [ ] Add rate caching and error handling for network failures

- Shared UI (`components/ui/*`)
  - [ ] Ensure all controls expose accessibility labels and aria attributes
  - [ ] Add unit tests for complex primitives (Select, Dialog behaviors)
  - [ ] Create Storybook stories for visual QA

### Backend / API

- Server actions (`/server/actions/*`)

  - [ ] Implement `createUser`, `updateUser`, `deleteUser` with proper validation
  - [ ] Add pagination and search for `getAllUsers`
  - [ ] Add transactions endpoints that update balances transactionally
  - [ ] Add audit logging for sensitive mutations

- Prisma Schema & Migrations
  - [ ] Add branch relations to Users and ExchangeRates if needed
  - [ ] Create migrations for any schema changes

### Testing & CI

- [ ] Unit tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions pipeline: lint â†’ test â†’ build

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Add `README` setup steps for local DB, env vars, and seeding
- [ ] Add scripts: `dev`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `format`
- [ ] Add `prettier` and `eslint` configs, and run auto-fix

### Security & Ops

- [ ] Ensure auth is enforced on all server actions and pages
- [ ] Rate limit sensitive APIs and add input validation
- [ ] Add monitoring (Sentry) and logging for errors

## Next steps I can take (pick one):

- Add `form.reset(defaultValues)` logic to `components/user-form.tsx` so the form updates when `defaultValues` changes (no remount needed).
- Implement `updateUser` server action and wire it to `UserForm` so editing saves changes.
- Add delete confirmation modal and optimistic UI for removing users.

Tell me which task you want me to implement first and I'll start right away.
